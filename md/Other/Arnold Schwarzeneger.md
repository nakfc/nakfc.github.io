## Work your ass off.
There is no magic pill. It drives me crazy to go to the GYM.

If you read one hour a day.I went and worked out 5 hours a day. And I was working in construction.

## You have 24 hours a day.
Organise your day.Work hard.

# I'm here to talk about success.

I went to college.I went and worked out 5 hours a day.And I was working in construction.

Beacuse in those days in bodybuilding there was no money.

I didn't have the money for food supplements or anything.

So I had go to work.

So I work in construction.

I went to college and worked out in a GYM.

And at night 8 o'clock at night to 12 midninght.I went to acting class 4 times a week.

As the same all that.There was not one single minute i wasted.

There is why I'm standing here today.

At the age of 20 I went to LONDON.And I won the MR.UNIVERSE contest as the youngest MR.UNIVERSE ever.

And it was becausse I had a goal.

You see If you don't have a vision of where you're going.

If you don't have a goal where to go,You drift around and never end up anywhere.

74% of people hate their job in America.The majority of people don't like what they're doing.

Because they are not doing it.Because they didn't had a goal and followed the goal.

They just aimlessly drift around and there is a job opening,so they get the job because they need to work.

But then when you work it is a chore `讨厌或烦琐的工作`. It's work.It's not fun.

So your think about only a quarter of people really enjoy what they're doing in life.

People always ask me,When they seen me in the GYM,In the pumping iron days.

They say why it is you are working out so hard,5 hours a day,6 hours a day.And you always have a smile on your face.

The others are working out just as hard as you do,And they look sour in the face.

Why is that?

I told people all the time,Beacuse to me,I am shotting for a goal,In font of me is the MR.UNIVERSE title.

So every rep that I do gets me close to accomplishing that goal.To make this goal,This vision `设想` trun to a reality.

Every single set that I do,Every repetition of weight that I lift will get me a step close to turning this goal into a reality.

So I couldn't wait to do another 500 pound squat `蹲举`. I couldn't wait to do another 500 pound bench press.I couldn't wait to do another 2000 sit-ups.I couldn't wait for the next exercise.

So let me tell you that visualising your goal and going after is makes it fun.You got to have a purpose no matter what you do in life you got to have a purpose.

# Muhammad ali
Muhammad ali worked his butt off,I saw it first hand,I remember there was sports waiter in the GYM,When ali was working out doing sit-ups,They ask he,"How many sit-ups do you do?"

And he said:I don't start counting until it hurts.

Now think about that,He doesn't start counting sit-ups until he feels pain that's when he starts counting.

That is working hard.

So you can't get around the hard work,It doesn't matter who you are.

Work your ass off. `努力奋斗`

There is no magic pill.

There is no magic out there.

Your can not get around,Your have to work and work.

For this To make sure that and all the stuff is work.

It's drives me crazy when people say they don't have enough time.

To go to the GYM 45 minutes a day and workout.Or to do something for 45 minutes to an hour a day to improve `提升自己`.

Either physically `身体上的` improve or mentally `精神` improve.

# Imagine
Imagine you read 1 hour a day about history,How much would you learn after 265 hours in one year.

Think about Imagine if you study the history of musicians and composers,How much you'd know.

Imagine if you worked on some business you wanted to develop every day for an hour.

Imagine how much further `进步` along you'd go,you'd get.

# 24 Hours

So it drives me nuts when people say:We don't have the time.

You have 24 hours a day.

We sleep 6 hours a day,So it still gives you 18 hours.

Theres someone shaking their head and possibly say:I don't sleep 6 hours I sleep 8 Hours.

Well,just sleep faster.

The average person works 8-10 hours,Lets assume it's 10 hours so we have 8 hours left.

Then you travel around an hour a day,Maybe 2 hours a day,So now you still have 6 hours left.

What do you do with these 6 hours?

Eat a little bit? Schmooze a little bit? Talk a little bit to people.

Can you see how much time is avaliable.If you organise your day.

So you got to work hard.

# I hate plan B

I'll tell you why.Because we have so many doubters.

We have so many people who say no. You can't do it. It's impossible.

That is okey because we just turn off.

As I said earlier

No **being** Yes

You can't do it **being** You can do it.

So it's possible `合理` to do that. Amongst all the nagative people around you.

But when you start doubting youself.That's very dangerous.

Because now what you're basically saying is, If my plan does not work, I have a fall back plan, A plan B.

That means you're thinkking about plan B.

Every thought you put into plan B. 

> You're taking away that thought and energy away from plan A.

It is very important.

To understand that we function better if there is no safety net.

Because plan B becomes a safety net. If I fail then a fail and I get picked back up. And I have something else there and it will protect me.

That's not good.

I'm telling you that I've never ever had a plan B.

I made a full commitment to be a bodybuilding champion.

I made a full commitment that I'll be in America.

I made a full commitment that I'm going to get into show business.

And I'm going to be a leading man no matter what it takes.I will do the work. I will do the work over and over and over.

Until I get it.

The same was in politics and everything like that.

To me it is very dangerous to have a plan B.

Because you are cutting yourself off from your chance of really succeeding.

The main peason people want a plan B is. **They are worried about failing**.

Don't be afraid of failing. Because there is nothing wrong with failing.

You have to fail in order to climb that ladder.There is no one that doesn't fail.

/** **/

> We all fail. It's okay. What's not okay is when you fail and you stay down. Whoever stays down is a loser.
